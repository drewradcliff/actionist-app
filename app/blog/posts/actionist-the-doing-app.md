With so many todo apps on the market already, do we really need
another one?

No you probably don't, but we think you might need a digital scratch
paper.

Actionist is that scratch paper turned todo notes.

Feeling pulled in a million directions by countless tasks? This app is
your solution. Just jot down your to-dos and start ticking them off
visually.

Research shows that it's best for our brain to not multi-task, but
this app is how, if you really have to (or want to, if you have ADHD
like me):

Actionist allows you to change your task from TODO to DOING; with the
DOING items pinned at the top, hopefully if you get distracted you can
find your way back on track!

## A little background story

If I don't write it down, it won't get done.

If I write them all down, it becomes overwhelming.

Here is a screenshot of what my main todo app (things3) inbox looks
like.

To this date, I still have countless items in things3 that would
probably will just keep wander in that void space that they call
cloud.

Have I tried other apps?

Oh you mean apps with more complexity, functionality and basically
more buttons?

Unfortunately, I have. Nope they don't do it for me. It is so
attempting to start organizing and get distraught by -- as in, how
could one actually organize all of them?

## The intended usage of actionist

Take a look at your actual todos, look through your emails, your
priorities systems, then, close your eyes and sip a coffee; now, what
can you _actually_ do at this moment?

Write them down, tick them off.

When you are done, just "pull to archive all".

You can even "archieve all" without being done â€” beauty of (an
electronic) scratch paper.

Alternatively, when a task is too big and too duanting, you can start
by breaking them down like so:

At this point you probably noticed that this app is not intended for
keeping and indexing your todos, please use another app for todos like
"how do i find meaning of life". Actionist wants you to focus on the
actionables, now.
